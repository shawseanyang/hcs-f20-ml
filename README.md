I went for option 1 and used data from [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/smeschke/four-shapes) to train a neural network that identifies what kind of shape an image is (out of circles, triangles, and squares). At about ~50 epochs both the testing accuracy and validation accuracy ended up around ~0.98 - 1.00.
